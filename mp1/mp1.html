      <h1>The mp1 Writeup</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 2023/1/24</p>

      <h2>Sorry that I was just a bit overwhelmed by workload and spring festival events, I will make sure have everything here by Wednesday. Thank you</h2>

      <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Firstly I have to setup my environment in order to program.
            Considering the content of this project, I created a new repository
            on github named as `Little C Shock`, the name of my extension, and
            clone to local directory.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Following the examples provided in class, I created the basic
            folders and files for the program, which are `manifest.json`, `popup\popup.html`,
            `popup\popup.css`, `popup\popup.js`, `content-script\conten.js`, and folders
            for my `images` and `media`.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: I copied the template for `manifest.json` and modified the
            the objects accordingly, including "manifest_version", "name", "description",
            "version", "action", "permissions", and "content_scripts". These will be
            constantly adjusted as I go with the project. I set the "default_popup" to
            be "popup/popup.html" and created an icon in the base directory, which is
            set to "default_icon" so chrome could recognize it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: I go to the "chrome://extensions/" in my chrome browser, load my extension
            so I can constanly test out the performance later during the process. Once I changed
            something in my code, I can simply clicked the refresh button.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Then I wrote the popup.html and popup.css. I have a checkbox in my popup
            window so that the user could switch on and off the functionality.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: I created files for both html and css for about me, cheatsheet, and MP0
            Writeup pages in the proper directory. Then I copied the coding from my index.html
            to them because I wanted to keep the basic layout, such as header, footer, and
            navigation bar. I then deleted the content under &lt;body&gt; to replace contents I
            want to have on these pages.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: I changed the links that connect to each page accordingly since the directory
            is different. I also put all the pictures I wanted to use in a folder called img for
            easy management and reference.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Lastly, I wrote the writeup, browsing between each page to make sure there is
            no bugs or typos.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>Issue: When I try to uncheck the checkbox in my pop-up window and disable the functionality of
          the extension manually, the javascript did not allow me to do that. No matter how I check or
          uncheck the box, the checkbox would always display as unchecked every time I open the pop-up window,
          and the detection functionality would remain active.

        <p>Solution: One issue I encountered was that as I am creating multiple subpages from my index.html, I
          wanted to apply the css styling from the main page to other pages for universal look and
          consistent aesthetics. However, I could not find a way to inherit or import the stylesheet
          like what we usually do with java and python. Simply copy and paste everything is redundent
          and nonoptimal for futur debugging and maintainence. Eventually, after many searching, I
          find out that I can link mutliple stylesheets in one html file, and the more specific
          styling can just overwrite the original.
        </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          · An organized gallery for showcasing all my projects and artworks.
        </li>
        <li>
          · A more aesthetically pleasing website that features the best color-color choice, nice fonts
          and sizes, as well as high quality images.
        </li>
        <li>
          · Some animation as the user navigate through the website, or right at the point when they encounter
          the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          · A little web game that is attached the the main page.
        </li>
      </ul>
