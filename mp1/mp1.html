      <h1>The mp1 Writeup</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 2023/1/24</p>

      <h2>Sorry that I was just a bit overwhelmed by workload and spring festival events, I will make sure have everything here by Monday. Thank you</h2>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Firstly I have to setup my environment in order to program.
            Considering the content of this project, I created a new repository
            on github named as `Little C Shock`, the name of my extension, and
            clone to local directory.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Following the examples provided in class, I created the basic
            folders and files for the program, which are `manifest.json`, `popup\popup.html`,
            `popup\popup.css`, `popup\popup.js`, `content-script\conten.js`, and folders
            for my `images` and `media`.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: I copied the template for `manifest.json` and modified the
            the objects accordingly, including "manifest_version", "name", "description",
            "version", "action", "permissions", and "content_scripts". These will be
            constantly adjusted as I go with the project. I set the "default_popup" to
            be "popup/popup.html" and created an icon in the base directory, which is
            set to "default_icon" so chrome could recognize it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: I go to the "chrome://extensions/" in my chrome browser, load my extension
            so I can constanly test out the performance later during the process. Once I changed
            something in my code, I can simply clicked the refresh button.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Then I wrote the popup.html and popup.css. I have a checkbox in my popup
            window so that the user could switch on and off the functionality.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: I created files for both html and css for about me, cheatsheet, and MP0
            Writeup pages in the proper directory. Then I copied the coding from my index.html
            to them because I wanted to keep the basic layout, such as header, footer, and
            navigation bar. I then deleted the content under &lt;body&gt; to replace contents I
            want to have on these pages.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: I changed the links that connect to each page accordingly since the directory
            is different. I also put all the pictures I wanted to use in a folder called img for
            easy management and reference.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Lastly, I wrote the writeup, browsing between each page to make sure there is
            no bugs or typos.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue</h2>
        <p>One issue I encountered was that as I am creating multiple subpages from my index.html, I
          wanted to apply the css styling from the main page to other pages for universal look and
          consistent aesthetics. However, I could not find a way to inherit or import the stylesheet
          like what we usually do with java and python. Simply copy and paste everything is redundent
          and nonoptimal for futur debugging and maintainence. Eventually, after many searching, I
          find out that I can link mutliple stylesheets in one html file, and the more specific
          styling can just overwrite the original.
        </p>

      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
        <p>The CSS Transition I utilized in this project is the class cards on the home page. The
          expected behavior is when you hover the mouse at the card, the actual course I am taking
          this quarter will slowly appear. This is actually the first time I hear and use the Transition
          feature of css. I chose this behavior is because I simply want to make some sort of card drawing
          and flipping animation as I am a huge fan of card tricks and card games. I achieve this
          functionabiltiy by using setting `transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;` for the text within
          each card and opacity as 0 as the initial state. In this way, the transition will change the
          opacity of the text in 0.5s as ease-in-out. However, in order to initiate this action, I need to
          set the text p:hover with css property opacity:1. So that when a cursor hover on the text, the
          opacity should change to 1, which displays. However, the cursor has to position on the text in
          order to make the behavior happen, where the text was originally unseen. Thus, I modified the box
          of the p element to make top, right, bottom, left all as zero so they cover the entire card container.
          The following is a gif of how the transition works.
        </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          · An organized gallery for showcasing all my projects and artworks.
        </li>
        <li>
          · A more aesthetically pleasing website that features the best color-color choice, nice fonts
          and sizes, as well as high quality images.
        </li>
        <li>
          · Some animation as the user navigate through the website, or right at the point when they encounter
          the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          · A little web game that is attached the the main page.
        </li>
      </ul>
