      <h1>The fp2 Writeup</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 2023/3/8</p>

      <h2>Eternal Dungeon</h2>

      <p><a href="https://snow-miku.github.io/Eternal-Dungeon/">Link</a> to my game</p>

      <p>
        This game is a advanced version of my mp3. It is a battle game
        that allow user to pick a character and beat enemy in a turn-based
        strategic form. The goal is to attack the enemy and empty its health
        bar. Once the enemy's hp reaches zero, a winning music will be played,
        and the player can choose to resume to the next level. The character
        can level up and the enemy will increase in difficulty as well.
      </p>

      <p>Following is are gifs of the two game behavior.</p>

          <img src="img/fp1-character-select.gif" class="sketch-box" alt="A gif of the character selection view">
      </div>

      <h2>Development process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Create new repository for the prototype, and migrate mp3
            into the new github repository.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Initialize the `package.json` with `npm init`. Install
            vite, gh-page, p5.play, and firebase. Update the package.json script
            accordingly so the server, build and deployment tool will function
            properly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: Implement the new interface, draw all the canva elements including
            new buttons and text prompts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: Implement the new damage and hp calculation formula that based of
            current levels.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Implement the new mechanics so that the boss will attack back in
            return every user attack.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: Rearrange the overall logic of the game so that certain behavior or
            user action can only happen at certain view.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: Finish the character selection panel. Make sure each sprite are clickable
            and will replace the player character.
          </p>
        </li>

        <p>Following is the middle process placeholder for character selection view.</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
          <img src="img/fp1-middle.png" alt="character selection view in progress">

        </div>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Test out all the behavior so that they are properly functioning. Deploy the
            site to github.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
      <p>Issue: As I tried to implement the character selection function, considering that I want
        easily modifying and adding new characters in the future, I was struggle on what data
        structure to use and how to make it work.

      <p>Solviong Process: I eventually decided to use Group() embedded in p5.play as it allows for
        a uniform styling of child sprite elements and function as an array, which perfectly suited
        for character avatars and information. However, this class is very unintuitive to use. I could
        not figure out how to specify which sprite i am looking at within the group, since I need to
        click on the sprite to select the character. Eventually, I figured out to use a for loop every
        time when my mouse clicked to determine the index of the sprite and use that for identifying
        the exact character player is clicking.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add proper stylings, including pleasing colors and music.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add database connection for player to save their character current level and data.
        </li>
        <li>
          More animations shown on characters attacking each other as the player activate attack.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add selection and fetching for different characters options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the use to choose which to enhance after level up, such as critical chance, damage or hp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add other movement options besides attack, such as defence, heal, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
