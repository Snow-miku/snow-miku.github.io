      <h1>The fp2 Writeup</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 2023/3/17</p>

      <h2>Eternal Dungeon</h2>

      <p><a href="https://snow-miku.github.io/Eternal-Dungeon/">Link</a> to my game</p>

      <p>
        This game is the completed version from the prototype (see fp1). It is a battle game
        that allow user to pick a character and beat enemy in a turn-based
        strategic form. The goal is to attack the enemy and empty its health
        bar. Once the enemy's hp reaches zero, a winning music will be played,
        and the player can choose to resume to the next level. The character
        can level up and the enemy will increase in difficulty as well.
      </p>

      <p>Following is are screenshots of the game menu and in-game view.</p>

          <img src="img/fp2-in-game.gif" class="sketch-box" alt="A gif of the in game view">
      </div>

      <h2>Development process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Create new repository for the prototype, and migrate fp1
            into the new github repository.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Initialize the `package.json` with `npm install`. It will
            install all the packages required for the project.
          </p>
        </li>
        <p>Following is the middle process before the enemy attack damage is implemented.</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
          <img src="img/fp2-middle-step.gif" class="sketch-box" alt="Battle scene in progress">
        </div>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: Added all the sprite necessary for showing damage towards the player,
            including prompts and hit effect.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: Implement the mechanism so that right now player can be defeated and
            instruct player to retry the game accordingly.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Implement the critical attack indication, which is main factor to determine
            whether player will win in the battle.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: Add all the new stylings and media, including new fonts, wallpaper,
            sound effects, and background musics. Apply them into the game at the proper
            phase.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: Add new characters into the selection menu.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Test out all the behavior so that they are properly functioning.
            Finish the writeup and deploy the game to github.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
      <p>Issue: Since I have many sprites functioned as buttons, and most them are centered
        at the page, many sprites overlayed and collided with each other and cause unwanted
        behavior such as altering the sprite direction.

      <p>Solviong Process: I tried many ways to solve it. First is slightly change the y
        coordinate position of each button so they are adjusted to prevent overlay. However,
        the total numbers of buttons were too many for this to work. I also tried to change
        the depth (does not work) and set collider to `none` (it will make these sprites
        unclickable), neither of which worked. Eventually, I combined some of the button
        sprites together by changing their text and function constantly.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add database connection for player to save their character current level and data.
        </li>
        <li>
          More animations shown on characters attacking each other as the player activate attack.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add selection and fetching for different characters options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the use to choose which to enhance after level up, such as critical chance, damage or hp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add other movement options besides attack, such as defence, heal, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
