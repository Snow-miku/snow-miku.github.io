      <h1>The MP0 Writeup</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 2023/1/10</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Firstly I have to setup my environment in order to program.
            Since I have used VSCode and conducted several web programming projects
            before, I just needed to download extensions such as Live Sever, and I
            picked Monokai Pro as the to-go theme.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Then I created the repository on github named as `username.github.io`
            so it recognized as user web. Next, clone the repository locally and copied
            and pasted the templated provided from the class github. Made a simple push,
            then, I am ready to add my own contents.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: Since I have done a simple personal website before, therfore, I
            followed that one as an example, finished a draft index html template with
            proper tags, heritage, classes' and ids' names. I also have looked up on
            what elements do a general portfolio website need to have so that I am using
            the right sementic tags and planned layout.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: I slowly added basic CSS styling in index.css, which including colors,
            fonts, universal margins and width for a consistent look. I also assigned
            different font sizes and colors for different levels of headings and texts.
            Up to this point, my website looks as bellow.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Then I keeps doing minor adjustments and testing them with the help
            of all in one developer toolbox in chrome. The livesever is also helpful in
            reflecting the real-time modification so I know what works and what does not.
            Many issues occurs in this step where I need to do iterative changing and testing
            to make the website ideal.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: I created files for both html and css for about me, cheatsheet, and MP0
            Writeup pages in the proper directory. Then I copied the coding from my index.html
            to them because I wanted to keep the basic layout, such as header, footer, and
            navigation bar. I then deleted the content under &lt;body&gt; to replace contents I
            want to have on these pages.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: I changed the links that connect to each page accordingly since the directory
            is different. I also put all the pictures I wanted to use in a folder called img for
            easy management and reference.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Lastly, I wrote the writeup, browsing between each page to make sure there is
            no bugs or typos.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue</h2>
        <p>One issue I encountered was that as I am creating multiple subpages from my index.html, I
          wanted to apply the css styling from the main page to other pages for universal look and
          consistent aesthetics. However, I could not find a way to inherit or import the stylesheet
          like what we usually do with java and python. Simply copy and paste everything is redundent
          and nonoptimal for futur debugging and maintainence. Eventually, after many searching, I
          find out that I can link mutliple stylesheets in one html file, and the more specific
          styling can just overwrite the original.
        </p>

      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
        <p>The CSS Transition I utilized in this project is the class cards on the home page. The
          expected behavior is when you hover the mouse at the card, the actual course I am taking
          this quarter will slowly appear. This is actually the first time I hear and use the Transition
          feature of css. I chose this behavior is because I simply want to make some sort of card drawing
          and flipping animation as I am a huge fan of card tricks and card games. I achieve this
          functionabiltiy by using setting `transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;` for the text within
          each card and opacity as 0 as the initial state. In this way, the transition will change the
          opacity of the text in 0.5s as ease-in-out. However, in order to initiate this action, I need to
          set the text p:hover with css property opacity:1. So that when a cursor hover on the text, the
          opacity should change to 1, which displays. However, the cursor has to position on the text in
          order to make the behavior happen, where the text was originally unseen. Thus, I modified the box
          of the p element to make top, right, bottom, left all as zero so they cover the entire card container.
          The following is a gif of how the transition works.
        </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>

          · An organized gallery for showcasing all my projects and artworks.
        </li>
        <li>
          · A more aesthetically pleasing website that features the best color-color choice, nice fonts
          and sizes, as well as high quality images.
        </li>
        <li>
          · Some animation as the user navigate through the website, or right at the point when they encounter
          the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          · A little web game that is attached the the main page.
        </li>
      </ul>
