      <h1>The mp3 Writeup</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 2023/2/21</p>

      <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>

      <p><a href="https://snow-miku.github.io/Dev-Toolchain-JRPG/">Link</a> to my game</p>

      <p>Tap Hero (Simple Ver.):</p>

      <p>
        This game is a battle game similar to "click hero" where the user just
        need to simple progress the attack button in order to damage the enemy.
        Click the start button to start a game. A battle theme song will be
        played. The goal is to attack the enemy and try to empty its health bar.
        Once the enemy's hp reaches zero, a winning music will be played, and a
        prompt will pop up to indicate your winning. After the music, the game
        will be initialized to its start menu.
      </p>

      <p>Following is a gif of the game in progress.</p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Download node.js on the device. Create a new git hub
            resporitory and set to public.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Initialize the `package.jspn` with `npm init`. Install
            the p5.play library.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: Create an index.html file with the copied template. Also,
            create the index.js file with the basic setup() and empty draw()
            funcitons.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: Install a local dev server, Rollup, the node-resolve plugin,
            the copy plugin, and the gh-pages package using npm.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          STPE 5: In package.json, copied the three scripts corresponded to the
            npm package installed:
            <ul>
              <li>"start": "web-dev-server --node-resolve --open --watch"</li>
              <li>"build": "rollup --config"</li>
              <li>"deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: Create folders for media. Prepare, download, rename, and
            organize the files.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: In index.js, write helper functions for creating the necessary
            sprites with p5.play and draw them at the proper coordinates.
          </p>
        </li>

        <p>Looks like the following:</p>
        <section class="flex-container">
          <img src="img/mp3-middle.png" alt="game in middle progress">
        </section>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Write functions for game mechanics, such as start, winning,
            and ending stages, as well as the game statistics behaviors.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 9: Debugs, tests, and polishes the game with npm run start.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 10: Create a configuration file for Rollup called rollup.config.js.
            Add necessary elements under copy plugin and `treeshake: false`.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 11: Deploy the webpage with npm run deploy and check if it is
            successfully deployed at `username.github.io/repositoryname`.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 12: Finish the writeup.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <p>Issue: As I tried to implement the health bar and make it have the effect of
          constantly reflecting the hp lost, I struggled on how to make the lost health
          only got deducted from the right side.

        <p>Solviong Process: Initially I only have one sprite representing the health bar,
          and I could not find any method that can only changes the color fill within the
          shape. Eventually, I decided to do two sprites the stacks on each other so one
          could be the outline and the other be the actuall health. However, it was hard
          to display the health correctly since the sprite are coordinated at the center
          in stead of the left corner. I managed to do the calculation of the current
          health percentage, and multiplied that with a saved original healthbar length.
          I also need to devided the position shift by two since it is referred to the
          center.
        </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          More animations shown on characters attacking each other as the player activate attack.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add randomness to the damage and have word prompt indicator for better hit response.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add turn-based mechanics so that the opponent could attack the player as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add selection for different characters swipes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add other movement options besides attack, such as defence, heal, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
