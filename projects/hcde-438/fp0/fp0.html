      <h2>Maou To Yuusha</h2>

      <p>
        This game is a battle game that allow user to pick a character
        and beat enemy in a turn-based strategic game. The character can
        level up and the enemy will increase in difficulty as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Two Versions of the Project</h2>

      <h3>Prototype version</h3>
      <p>
        The prototype version will have a complete menu interface where the user
        can set up their character. It will use the firebase for storing character
        data such as the look, level, and damage. This version will also have
        the entire functionality for the game control mechanics that it will shift
        face when the user click start game, increase the difficulty of the enemy
        as the player progresses, and choices for the player to either attack, save
        the game, or defence. The enemy will also be implemented to attack back after
        every player attack.
      </p>

      <h3>Final version</h3>
      <p>
        It will allow user to switch to different character with an input of character
        name if it is fetchable. Also, the music, background picture, and the styling
        of the interface will be further enhanced for aesthetics. Moreover, a more
        profound calculation of the attack damage will be implemented so that user
        can view character's attack, defence, and hp statistics.
      </p>

      <h2>Development process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Create new repository for the prototype, and tranplant mp3
            into the new github repository.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Initialize the `package.json` with `npm init`. Install
            a local development server, a build tool, a deployment tool, and
            any library necessary. Update the package.json script accordingly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: Implement the new interface, draw all the canvas elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: Add functionality for the attack to be turn-based, and the
            enemy is able to fight back. Also store the difficulty level, so the
            enemy will gain higher attack damage and hp after every player win.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>MILESTONE: PROTOTYPE VERSION.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Update the music and background image in different phase of
            the application.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: Add funtions to query API for characters' name and image, and
            allow user to change it in settings/characters.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: Implement cross-platform accessibility so the game works in
            different devices.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Debugs, tests, and polishes the game.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>MILESTONE: FINAL VERSION.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allow the player to choose and use different spells.
        </li>
