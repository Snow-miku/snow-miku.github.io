      <h2>Eternal Dungeon</h2>

      <p><a href="https://snow-miku.github.io/Eternal-Dungeon-DEMO/">Link</a> to my game</p>

      <p>
        This game is a advanced version of my mp3. It is a battle game
        that allow user to pick a character and beat enemy in a turn-based
        strategic form. The goal is to attack the enemy and empty its health
        bar. Once the enemy's hp reaches zero, a winning music will be played,
        and the player can choose to resume to the next level. The character
        can level up and the enemy will increase in difficulty as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Development process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Create new repository for the prototype, and migrate mp3
            into the new github repository.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Initialize the `package.json` with `npm init`. Install
            vite, gh-page, p5.play, and firebase. Update the package.json script
            accordingly so the server, build and deployment tool will function
            properly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: Implement the new interface, draw all the canva elements including
            new buttons and text prompts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: Implement the new damage and hp calculation formula that based of
            current levels.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Implement the new mechanics so that the boss will attack back in
            return every user attack.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
      <p>Issue: As I tried to implement the health bar and make it have the effect of
        constantly reflecting the hp lost, I struggled on how to make the lost health
        only got deducted from the right side.

      <p>Solviong Process: Initially I only have one sprite representing the health bar,
        and I could not find any method that can only changes the color fill within the
        shape. Eventually, I decided to do two sprites the stacks on each other so one
        could be the outline and the other be the actuall health. However, it was hard
        to display the health correctly since the sprite are coordinated at the center
        in stead of the left corner. I managed to do the calculation of the current
        health percentage, and multiplied that with a saved original healthbar length.
        I also need to devided the position shift by two since it is referred to the
        center.
      </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add database connection for player to save their character current level and data.
        </li>
        <li>
          More animations shown on characters attacking each other as the player activate attack.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add selection and fetching for different characters options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the use to choose which to enhance after level up, such as critical chance, damage or hp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add other movement options besides attack, such as defence, heal, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
