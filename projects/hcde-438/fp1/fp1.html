      <h2>Maou To Yuusha</h2>

      <p><a href="https://snow-miku.github.io/Dev-Toolchain-JRPG/">Link</a> to my game</p>

      <p>
        This game is a advanced version of my mp3. It is a battle game
        that allow user to pick a character and beat enemy in a turn-based
        strategic form. The goal is to attack the enemy and empty its health
        bar. Once the enemy's hp reaches zero, a winning music will be played,
        and the player can choose to resume to the next level. The character
        can level up and the enemy will increase in difficulty as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Two Versions of the Project</h2>

      <h3>Prototype version</h3>
      <p>
        The prototype version will have a complete menu interface where the user
        can set up their character. It will use the firebase for storing character
        data such as the look, level, and damage. This version will also have
        the entire functionality for the game control mechanics that it will shift
        face when the user click start game, increase the difficulty of the enemy
        as the player progresses, and choices for the player to either attack, save
        the game, or defence. The enemy will also be implemented to attack back after
        every player attack.
      </p>

      <h3>Final version</h3>
      <p>
        It will allow user to switch to different character with an input of character
        name if it is fetchable. Also, the music, background picture, and the styling
        of the interface will be further enhanced for aesthetics. Moreover, a more
        profound calculation of the attack damage will be implemented so that user
        can view character's attack, defence, and hp statistics.
      </p>

      <h2>Development process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 1: Create new repository for the prototype, and tranplant mp3
            into the new github repository.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 2: Initialize the `package.json` with `npm init`. Install
            a local development server, a build tool, a deployment tool, and
            any library necessary. Update the package.json script accordingly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 3: Implement the new interface, draw all the canvas elements.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>STPE 4: Add functionality for the attack to be turn-based, and the
            enemy is able to fight back. Also store the difficulty level, so the
            enemy will gain higher attack damage and hp after every player win.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>MILESTONE: PROTOTYPE VERSION.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 5: Update the music and background image in different phase of
            the application.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 6: Add funtions to query API for characters' name and image, and
            allow user to change it in settings/characters.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 7: Implement cross-platform accessibility so the game works in
            different devices.
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>STPE 8: Debugs, tests, and polishes the game.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>MILESTONE: FINAL VERSION.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Known unknowns</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use firebase to store and fetch data for characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          How to deploy two versions explicitly on github.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use p5 for cross-platform accessibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Query an online API for character names and images.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using vite for dev server and build tool.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allow the player to choose and use different spells.
        </li>
        <li>
          Allow the use to choose which to enhance after level up,
          such as damage or hp.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
      <p>Issue: As I tried to implement the health bar and make it have the effect of
        constantly reflecting the hp lost, I struggled on how to make the lost health
        only got deducted from the right side.

      <p>Solviong Process: Initially I only have one sprite representing the health bar,
        and I could not find any method that can only changes the color fill within the
        shape. Eventually, I decided to do two sprites the stacks on each other so one
        could be the outline and the other be the actuall health. However, it was hard
        to display the health correctly since the sprite are coordinated at the center
        in stead of the left corner. I managed to do the calculation of the current
        health percentage, and multiplied that with a saved original healthbar length.
        I also need to devided the position shift by two since it is referred to the
        center.
      </p>

    <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        More animations shown on characters attacking each other as the player activate attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add randomness to the damage and have word prompt indicator for better hit response.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add turn-based mechanics so that the opponent could attack the player as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add selection for different characters swipes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add other movement options besides attack, such as defence, heal, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
